The buffet is the only way to go here because the meals are overpriced and  portions are small,  Now the service is horrible, inattentive at best , I don't feel welcomed and the servers I have had were flippant and the last time argued with us regarding the tea, we were served tea that was old but he insisted it was fine. Kinda aggravating. So if you are just looking for some good indian buffet, with out service not a bad place.                                                 \n",

We needed good vegetarian food and good beer within walking distance of my place, and it fit the bill perfectly. \\nI thought the chef's choice appetizers were delicious and a great deal, as well as the beer selection and prices. The entrees were tasty too, but I've had much better indian food.\\nOur waiter was patient and cheerful, and best of all, we ate al fresco, and the weather was so gorgeous, a man at the table next to us in his magnanimity, treated us to almond joy ice cream. mmm.\n",
              "361192  2       The place was just ill maintained and dirty. All the tables had food remnants. The food was really bad - the snacks were soaked in oil and served in paper plates and cups. The batata wada was stale. The thali was tolerable but mostly insipid. The cherry on the pan had gone bad. The serving staff were simultaneously serving and mopping the floor. \\n\\nWe go often to the Rajbhog in the triangle area but this one in Charlotte just does not cut the mustard. You'll be better off at Woodlands or some other indian joint.                                "
