Is that even legal?? \\n\\nI asked where customers were expected to use the restroom after eating and drinking at their establishment. The girl informed me that customers can go \\\"next door to Fat Tuesday\\\". \\nThere are 2 MAJOR issues with that:\\n1 - you can't get into Fat Tuesday (a bar) if you aren't 21, so late night 20 year old sandwich eaters better have big ass bladders.\\n2 - the line to get into Fat Tuesday is sometimes about 20 people long, then once you get carded, get inside, and navigate through the crowd, the bathroom line for the ladies room is another 10-15 long. This means if you leave Jimmy Johns in the middle of eating to pee, you must be 21+ and you will be gone for 20 minutes to an hour to take a leak next door. You can then come back to your crusty sandwich and your annoyed friends who have been babysitting your food while you went pee pee partying over at Tuesdays. Screw that.\\n\\nI'll tell you right now, if I were a guy, I seriously would've pissed on their floor under my table. But...as a girl, that could be messy for me.

I came in with a pocket knife (I am a woman mind you) only to have it confiscated at the door. This wasn't too much to ask as I understand the need for a safe environment. I do want to make it known that I carry my pocket knife everywhere and have never had it confiscated at any of the bars on Fremont. I forgot to get it back that night but came back the next day to grab it. \\n\\nThe only person that was available to talk was the barista that worked the counter at the coffee shop. She informed me that the knife was potbelly locked away in a safe because she couldn't find it. She took down my information and told me she would call once my knife was found. She called me with in a few hours to let me know my knife was there and safe. I was unable to come on Saturday night because I had to work. I came back on Sunday and Monday during the day and found the establishment  closed on both of hose days. Because I work and go to school full time, tonight was the first day I could come back. \\n\\nI was greeted by security and waited for about 15 minutes for the manager to come from upstairs to open the safe that my knife was supposedly kept in. After waiting for the manger for 15 minutes, the manager informs me that there was in fact no knife in the safe. This left me very confused. After gathering my thoughts and confusion, approached the manager with my question about the whereabouts of my pocket knife. After a few minutes the director of security became involved. The director went on to ask me why they would even bother putting someone's knife in safe to begin with. I was just as confused about that as he was. I went on to ask him why several people would tell me that my property was put in a safe and why the where about of my property we're know one day and unknown the next. I also asked his if he was concerned about his employees taking property from customers, specifically weapons. \\n\\nBoth gentlemen were unconcerned with the fact that a weapon was missing and that a customer was very unhappy with losing property at their establishment. Both of these gentlemen need to be taught a few lessons on how to talk and deal with customers. I am very upset and am looking into how I can get this resolved. This security team is very unprofessional in every way possible. I can get past the value of my knife, what's harder to get past is the unclear communication about the situation and the ignorance of the incompetence of their own company and team.</td>\n",

I recently moved to CA and still go visit them when I'm in town!\\n\\nLet me first start by saying that I did have one HORRIBLE experience here when I made an appointment for a partial highlight and cut with Kasondra on a whim. My normal gal did not have any available appointments so I decided to test Kasondra out-BAD IDEA. I came in and took the time to explain in detail the type of color and look I wanted. She was very sweet during the process, however when she was finished there was absolutely no difference at all!!! I am naturally a brunette and have always liked to have natural-looking golden blonde highlights. Kasondra gave me no blonde color and my highlights looked brassy and unnatural. On top of that I had asked for a trim of my layers and it literally looked like someone had taken a butcher knife to my hair. It was completely uneven! I went into work the next day and my boss felt so bad for me she allowed me to take 3 hours off to go get my hair fixed!\\n\\nEnter Tawni-the owner of the salon. I called in a panic needing to get my hair fixed as I was leaving town on vacation. The salon offered to put me with Kasondra again but, needless to say, I was not excited about that option. Tawni was AMAZING! She completely fixed Kasondra's botched job on my hair and made my highlights and color look phenomenal! Tawni was also so interactive and engaging the whole time I was in her chair. Her assistant Sonni even gave the most wonderful scalp massage! Since then I will only see Tawni and trust her with my hair! One thing I will say is since she is the owner of the salon and very busy you are often there for a long time with other stylists washing your hair and blowdrying/styling you.\\n\\nI gave this review 4 stars because the salon is so quaint, the staff is lovely, and Tawni is awesome! I will never go back to Kasondra again, but Tawni's service recovery turned a horrible situation into a positive one.</td>\n",

Eggplant was so good my date and I couldn't figure out if it was eggplant!\\n\\nCantonese Style Roasted Duck with Wild Huckleberries, Ginger and Stir-Fried Baby Bok Choy - $20\\nHuge and delicious, and unexpected as we thought we were only getting 1 main course to share.  Needless to say we had plenty of leftovers.\\n\\nEven with the discount I spent a bit more than I had hoped, but everything was delicious and the service was great, as well.  Oh, and they have an amazing bread platter.  Wish I was hungrier and got to try more of that!\\n\\nThanks, Drew W &amp; Scott G!</td>\n",

       "32328  If you are a human being and thus may at some point after midnight need to pee or poop, don't eat here. The restaurant is open until 3 or 4 a.m. and is quite willing to take your money and serve you food and biiiiiiiiig giant sodas, but beware...their restroom closes at midnight. \\n\\nI couldn't believe that as a customer, eating in, I was not allowed to use the restroom. Is that even legal?? \\n\\nI asked where customers were expected to use the restroom after eating and drinking at their establishment. The girl informed me that customers can go \\\"next door to Fat Tuesday\\\". \\nThere are 2 MAJOR issues with that:\\n1 - you can't get into Fat Tuesday (a bar) if you aren't 21, so late night 20 year old sandwich eaters better have big ass bladders.\\n2 - the line to get into Fat Tuesday is sometimes about 20 people long, then once you get carded, get inside, and navigate through the crowd, the bathroom line for the ladies room is another 10-15 long. This means if you leave Jimmy Johns in the middle of eating to pee, you must be 21+ and you will be gone for 20 minutes to an hour to take a leak next door. You can then come back to your crusty sandwich and your annoyed friends who have been babysitting your food while you went pee pee partying over at Tuesdays. Screw that.\\n\\nI'll tell you right now, if I were a guy, I seriously would've pissed on their floor under my table. But...as a girl, that could be messy for me. So...lucky for you Jimmy Johns...I was born without a penis. You win the prize of no pee on your floor, but you will never win my business EVER again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "48344  Is it possible to rate an establishment with less than 1 star? The security team here is a joke. I came in with a pocket knife (I am a woman mind you) only to have it confiscated at the door. This wasn't too much to ask as I understand the need for a safe environment. I do want to make it known that I carry my pocket knife everywhere and have never had it confiscated at any of the bars on Fremont. I forgot to get it back that night but came back the next day to grab it. \\n\\nThe only person that was available to talk was the barista that worked the counter at the coffee shop. She informed me that the knife was potbelly locked away in a safe because she couldn't find it. She took down my information and told me she would call once my knife was found. She called me with in a few hours to let me know my knife was there and safe. I was unable to come on Saturday night because I had to work. I came back on Sunday and Monday during the day and found the establishment  closed on both of hose days. Because I work and go to school full time, tonight was the first day I could come back. \\n\\nI was greeted by security and waited for about 15 minutes for the manager to come from upstairs to open the safe that my knife was supposedly kept in. After waiting for the manger for 15 minutes, the manager informs me that there was in fact no knife in the safe. This left me very confused. After gathering my thoughts and confusion, approached the manager with my question about the whereabouts of my pocket knife. After a few minutes the director of security became involved. The director went on to ask me why they would even bother putting someone's knife in safe to begin with. I was just as confused about that as he was. I went on to ask him why several people would tell me that my property was put in a safe and why the where about of my property we're know one day and unknown the next. I also asked his if he was concerned about his employees taking property from customers, specifically weapons. \\n\\nBoth gentlemen were unconcerned with the fact that a weapon was missing and that a customer was very unhappy with losing property at their establishment. Both of these gentlemen need to be taught a few lessons on how to talk and deal with customers. I am very upset and am looking into how I can get this resolved. This security team is very unprofessional in every way possible. I can get past the value of my knife, what's harder to get past is the unclear communication about the situation and the ignorance of the incompetence of their own company and team.  \n",
       "43089  Sunday brunch, is just average, nothing special. As for the selection I felt it lacked in variety...basic breakfast foods and flatbread pizzas. (Upstream set the bar high for brunch) the food wasn't cold but  could've been hotter. Previous reviews said the beer was watered down, it must be a theme w/their alcohol selections b/c the Bloody Mary was watered down as we'll, I'm not sure if it's the mix they used...have definitely had better.  The atmosphere is cool and it was packed, but just don't see what all the hype is about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "38033  This location has a much bigger seating area than other locations, which is a big plus in the morning.\\n\\nHowever, their quality control is severely lacking. I love the smokehouse sausage breakfast sandwich but the last one I got  was from here and it was terrible. The sausages tasted uncooked, the egg was about twice the size of the english muffin, and the english muffin itself had been cooked way too long (not burned, but hard).\\n\\nAnother small plus, since theyre bigger, they tend to have more than one box of each flavor of KCup packs available. But if you purchase one, you have to deal w/ their register guy who is really not the brightest bulb in the box. Thats mean, I know, but its unfortunately true. Ive had the same guy 4 times and ive experienced slow service, having my order voided 2-3 times because wrong buttons were pushed, a reply of \\\"Huh?\\\" to every order Ive made....super frustrating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "21419  After having the ice cream cookie sandwich from next door I felt we needed just a little something else.. so I had a 'like it', sweet and tart ice cream, meh.. its their attempt at the tangy tart fro yo which was mediocre at best. They need to focus on their strengths. However the customer service in here was awesome! 3 adorable and friendly guys who were super eager to help! Such a great change from the usual little bitches behind the counter.

       "8947   I have been going to Altered Ego for a while now and absolutely love it! I recently moved to CA and still go visit them when I'm in town!\\n\\nLet me first start by saying that I did have one HORRIBLE experience here when I made an appointment for a partial highlight and cut with Kasondra on a whim. My normal gal did not have any available appointments so I decided to test Kasondra out-BAD IDEA. I came in and took the time to explain in detail the type of color and look I wanted. She was very sweet during the process, however when she was finished there was absolutely no difference at all!!! I am naturally a brunette and have always liked to have natural-looking golden blonde highlights. Kasondra gave me no blonde color and my highlights looked brassy and unnatural. On top of that I had asked for a trim of my layers and it literally looked like someone had taken a butcher knife to my hair. It was completely uneven! I went into work the next day and my boss felt so bad for me she allowed me to take 3 hours off to go get my hair fixed!\\n\\nEnter Tawni-the owner of the salon. I called in a panic needing to get my hair fixed as I was leaving town on vacation. The salon offered to put me with Kasondra again but, needless to say, I was not excited about that option. Tawni was AMAZING! She completely fixed Kasondra's botched job on my hair and made my highlights and color look phenomenal! Tawni was also so interactive and engaging the whole time I was in her chair. Her assistant Sonni even gave the most wonderful scalp massage! Since then I will only see Tawni and trust her with my hair! One thing I will say is since she is the owner of the salon and very busy you are often there for a long time with other stylists washing your hair and blowdrying/styling you.\\n\\nI gave this review 4 stars because the salon is so quaint, the staff is lovely, and Tawni is awesome! I will never go back to Kasondra again, but Tawni's service recovery turned a horrible situation into a positive one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "10016  In my 8 years living in Las Vegas, I never had a chance to try Spago.  I view it as a bit out of price range, so when their 20 Year Anniversary came up with roll-back pricing, I had to try it.  Went last night with my date, and we asked the assistant GM Drew to pick our food.  Here's what he picked, and my thoughts on each:\\n\\nSignature Roasted Beet Goat Cheese Salad\\nI never would have ordered this but it was delicious.\\n\\nHouse Smoked Sturgeon, Crisp Potato Galette, Horseradish Cream - $12\\nIt was like a spicy latke with fish on top.  Really good.\\n\\n\\n\\\"Chinois Style\\\" Colorado Lamb Chops, Cilantro Mint Vinaigrette, Sweet & Sour Eggplant - $33\\nTender and delicious even without the sauce.  Eggplant was so good my date and I couldn't figure out if it was eggplant!\\n\\nCantonese Style Roasted Duck with Wild Huckleberries, Ginger and Stir-Fried Baby Bok Choy - $20\\nHuge and delicious, and unexpected as we thought we were only getting 1 main course to share.  Needless to say we had plenty of leftovers.\\n\\nEven with the discount I spent a bit more than I had hoped, but everything was delicious and the service was great, as well.  Oh, and they have an amazing bread platter.  Wish I was hungrier and got to try more of that!\\n\\nThanks, Drew W & Scott G!
